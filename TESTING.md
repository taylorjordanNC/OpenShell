## Running Tests

```bash
mise run test          # Rust + Python unit tests
mise run e2e           # End-to-end tests (starts a Docker-backed gateway)
mise run ci            # Everything: lint, compile checks, and tests
```

## Test Layout

```text
crates/*/src/          # Inline #[cfg(test)] modules
crates/*/tests/        # Rust integration tests
python/openshell/      # Python unit tests (*_test.py suffix)
e2e/python/            # Python E2E tests (test_*.py prefix)
e2e/rust/              # Rust CLI E2E tests
```

## Rust Tests

Unit tests live inline with `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks. Integration tests
go in `crates/*/tests/` and are named `*_integration.rs`.

Use `#[tokio::test]` for anything async:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn store_round_trip() {
        let store = Store::connect("sqlite::memory:").await.unwrap();
        store.put("sandbox", "abc", "my-sandbox", b"payload").await.unwrap();
        let record = store.get("sandbox", "abc").await.unwrap().unwrap();
        assert_eq!(record.payload, b"payload");
    }
}
```

Run Rust tests only:

```bash
mise run test:rust     # cargo test --workspace
```

Rust validation checks tracked Cargo lockfiles; run `mise run rust:lockfiles:check` to check them directly. If one is stale, refresh it with Cargo using its adjacent manifest, review the diff, and commit the update.

### Native Windows validation

Use `mise run --skip-tools pre-commit` with the existing Rust/MSVC toolchain.
Windows now checks tracked Cargo lockfiles through PowerShell rather than
skipping them. The deterministic gateway parity task uses Git for Windows Bash,
with temporary Python launchers confined to a unique checkout-owned directory.

`mise run --skip-tools sdk:ts:ci` selects the x64 Biome executable on Windows
(including ARM64 hosts running it under emulation), resolves the protobuf
plugin through its Windows `.cmd` launcher, and installs the matching locked
ARM64 Rolldown binding when Node itself is ARM64. The helper preserves lockfile
resolution; it must not upgrade unrelated test dependencies.

`mise run --skip-tools go:ci` retains race detection except on Windows ARM64,
where Go does not support it. Windows token-file tests explicitly skip POSIX
mode-bit assertions; those skips do not establish Windows ACL protection.
Use a checkout with LF text files when running Unix-shell fixture checks.

## Python Unit Tests

Python unit tests use the `*_test.py` suffix convention (not `test_*` prefix)
and live alongside the source in `python/openshell/`. They use mock-based
patterns with fake gRPC stubs:

```python
def test_exec_python_serializes_callable_payload() -> None:
    stub = _FakeStub()
    client = _client_with_fake_stub(stub)

    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b

    result = client.exec_python("sandbox-1", add, args=(2, 3))
    assert result.exit_code == 0
```

Run Python unit tests only:

```bash
mise run test:python   # uv run pytest python/
```

## E2E Tests

E2E tests run against a live gateway. By default, `mise run e2e` starts an
ephemeral standalone gateway with the Docker compute driver, runs the suite,
and cleans it up afterward. To run the suite against an existing plaintext
gateway, set `OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT`:

```bash
OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:18080 mise run e2e
```

Raw endpoint mode is HTTP-only. Use a named gateway config when a gateway
requires mTLS.

### Python E2E (`e2e/python/`)

`mise run e2e:python` builds `openshell/e2e-python:dev` from
`e2e/python/Dockerfile.workload` and selects it only for the test gateway.
This Noble-based fixture supplies the `sandbox` user, Python tooling, Git,
and a writable `/sandbox/.venv`. Its Python version comes from `.python-version`
so cloudpickle code objects match the test runner. The production workload
default remains the unmodified NVIDIA Ubuntu image.

The Rust Docker harness also selects this fixture for tests that need tools
or the named user. Explicit `--from` or `--template` arguments and the default-image
tests retain their own image selection. Docker sandbox and support-container
fixtures use the fixed image name; no workload-image override is needed.
Podman, VM, and Kubernetes retain their existing pinned, pullable fixture and
image setup. Conformance-only runs do not need the Docker fixture.
Build the Docker fixture separately with `mise run e2e:workload:build`.

Tests use the `sandbox` fixture from `conftest.py` to create real sandboxes:

```python
def test_exec_returns_stdout(sandbox):
    with sandbox(delete_on_exit=True) as sb:
        result = sb.exec(["echo", "hello"])
        assert result.exit_code == 0
        assert "hello" in result.stdout
```

#### `Sandbox.exec_python`

`exec_python` serializes a Python callable with `cloudpickle`, sends it to the
sandbox, and returns the result. Because cloudpickle serializes module-level
functions by reference (which fails inside the sandbox), use one of these
patterns:

**Closures from factory functions:**

```python
def _make_adder():
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    return add

def test_addition(sandbox):
    with sandbox(delete_on_exit=True) as sb:
        result = sb.exec_python(_make_adder(), args=(2, 3))
        assert result.stdout.strip() == "5"
```

**Bound methods on local classes:**

```python
def test_multiply(sandbox):
    class Calculator:
        def multiply(self, a, b):
            return a * b

    with sandbox(delete_on_exit=True) as sb:
        result = sb.exec_python(Calculator().multiply, args=(6, 7))
        assert result.stdout.strip() == "42"
```

#### Shared Fixtures (`e2e/python/conftest.py`)

| Fixture | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sandbox_client` | session | gRPC client connected to the active gateway |
| `sandbox` | function | Factory returning a `Sandbox` context manager |

### Rust CLI E2E (`e2e/rust/`)

Rust-based e2e tests that exercise the `openshell` CLI binary as a subprocess.
They live in the `openshell-e2e` crate and use a shared harness for sandbox
lifecycle management, output parsing, and cleanup.

Suites:

- Common suite (`--features e2e`) - driver-neutral CLI behavior, sandbox lifecycle, sync, port forwarding, policy, and provider tests.
- CLI conformance (`openshell-conformance`) - named scenarios for lifecycle,
  mechanistic drafts, and the sandbox-local API, including agent-authored
  permission requests. Driver E2E wrappers run every scenario. The
  installed-artifact conformance suite runs all scenarios and offers a focused
  `policy-advisor` testsuite for manual integration runs.
- Driver suites (`--features e2e-docker`, `e2e-podman`, `e2e-kubernetes`, or
  `e2e-vm`) - CLI conformance plus the common and driver-specific coverage for
  the selected deployment.
- Docker suite (`--features e2e-docker`) - includes Docker-only coverage such as Dockerfile image builds, Docker preflight checks, and managed Docker gateway start.
- Docker GPU suite (`--features e2e-docker-gpu`) - Docker suite plus GPU sandbox smoke coverage.
- VM suite (`--features e2e-vm`) - runs e2e tests on a VM.
- Kubernetes credential-driver suite (`--features e2e-kubernetes-credential-drivers`) - targeted Kubernetes Secrets and Vault provider credential storage coverage.

GPU device-selection tests compare OpenShell sandboxes against a plain Docker or
Podman container that requests `--device nvidia.com/gpu=all`. The probe image
defaults to the image used by the `gateway` stage in
`deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images`; set `OPENSHELL_E2E_GPU_PROBE_IMAGE` to
override it. Per-device checks run only for NVIDIA CDI device IDs reported by
the runtime's discovered devices list, so WSL2 hosts that expose only
`nvidia.com/gpu=all` skip the index-based cases. Exact CDI device selection is
passed through `--driver-config-json` with the active Docker or Podman driver
key.

Run the Docker-backed Rust CLI e2e suite:

```shell
mise run e2e:docker
```

Run the minimal portable CLI conformance profile against the gateway selected
in your OpenShell CLI configuration:

```shell
mise run e2e:cli-conformance
```

The gateway must already be installed, reachable, and selected before the task
starts. The task does not provision a gateway or select a compute driver. Set
`OPENSHELL_BIN` to test a prebuilt CLI; otherwise, the task builds the CLI from
the current checkout.

The phase-1 scenario verifies the complete CLI-to-gateway-to-driver path without
depending on how the gateway was installed or which driver is configured. It
requires machine-readable gRPC status, creates a uniquely named detached
sandbox with the configured default image, verifies the sandbox is `Ready` by finding its
unique name in paginated JSON list output, executes `echo` with a run-specific
marker, deletes the sandbox, and verifies that its name no longer appears.
Driver suites enable the same profile
instead of maintaining a separate smoke implementation. Sandbox lifecycle,
label matrices, VM overlay, and TLS-key permission assertions remain regular
E2E coverage.

Each invocation prints a ten-character run ID before creating resources.
Conformance sandboxes use names such as `ct-<run-id>-01`. The runner tracks the
exact name and uses it for cleanup; phase 1 does not add ownership labels.

The runner deletes owned resources after both success and failure. If the test
process is interrupted before cleanup, locate leftovers without touching
unrelated gateway state:

```shell
openshell sandbox list --output json
openshell sandbox delete <sandbox-name>
```

Gateway-backed Rust E2E tasks build the standalone conformance CLI, run its
registered scenarios against the configured gateway, then run any lane-specific
Rust tests that still apply. Run the Podman-backed Rust CLI e2e suite:

```shell
mise run e2e:podman
```

Run the VM-backed Rust CLI e2e suite:

```shell
mise run e2e:vm
```

Run the targeted Kubernetes credential-driver e2e suite. This deploys an
OpenBao fixture for the Vault-compatible driver path and validates Kubernetes
Secrets and Vault storage backends one at a time:

```shell
mise run e2e:kubernetes:credential-drivers
```

### Kubernetes E2E (`e2e/rust/e2e-kubernetes.sh`)

Kubernetes e2e tests deploy an OpenShell gateway into a real Kubernetes cluster
via Helm and run the Rust e2e suite against it. On vanilla Kubernetes the harness
reaches the gateway through `kubectl port-forward`; on OpenShift it instead uses a
passthrough Route secured with mandatory mTLS (see the OpenShift note below).

Run with an ephemeral k3d cluster (macOS; created and torn down automatically):

```shell
mise run e2e:kubernetes
```

Target an existing cluster (kind, k3d, or OpenShift):

```shell
OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT=my-context mise run e2e:kubernetes
```

Scope to a single test for local debugging:

```shell
OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBE_TEST=smoke mise run e2e:kubernetes
```

**OpenShift**: when the target cluster exposes the `route.openshift.io` API
group, the harness automatically applies SCC-compatible Helm overrides, grants
the required SCCs (`privileged` to `openshell-sandbox`, and `anyuid` to the
PostgreSQL fixture for DB scenarios), and drives the gateway through a
passthrough Route with mandatory mTLS instead of port-forward. No extra flags are
needed, but `oc` must be installed and authenticated against the target cluster
with permission to modify SCC bindings (`oc adm policy add-scc-to-user`) — the
harness exits early if `oc` is missing. The SCC grants and extracted client
mTLS material are removed during cleanup, including on failure or interrupt.

On a **remote** cluster, drop the `e2e-host-gateway` feature. Those tests rely
on the sandbox-side `host.openshell.internal` alias reaching the machine running
the tests, which is unreachable from pods on a remote cluster, so they fail.
Left enabled, the `host_gateway_alias` suite fails because
`host.openshell.internal` does not resolve inside the pod, so the gateway
SSRF-denies the request (`DNS resolution failed` / `ssrf_denied`) — a networking
property of remote pods, not a gateway or transport fault. Override
`OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBERNETES_FEATURES` to exclude it:

```shell
OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT=$(oc config current-context) \
  OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBERNETES_FEATURES="e2e,e2e-kubernetes" \
  mise run e2e:kubernetes
```

On an existing cluster the harness builds the CLI from your branch but pulls the
**published** gateway/supervisor image (default tag `latest`). The CLI and the
image can therefore be different versions. If tests fail because of this version
difference — for example, sandbox tests fail with `Pod exists with phase: Failed`
or connect-based tests stall because the deployed image predates a feature your
branch CLI needs — set `IMAGE_TAG` to an image that matches your branch.

The `latest` tag lags to the last semver release, so it is often older than
`main`. Two better choices:

- `IMAGE_TAG=dev` — a floating tag that tracks the latest `main` build. Good for
  an ad-hoc run when your branch is close to `main` HEAD. Because it floats, two
  runs on different days can pull different images, so it is not reproducible.
- **Pin the exact commit your branch is based on** — deterministic and immune to
  a floating tag moving. Published tags are the full 40-char git SHA (semver tags
  without a `v` prefix also exist but only for released versions):

```shell
OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT=$(oc config current-context) \
  OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBERNETES_FEATURES="e2e,e2e-kubernetes" \
  IMAGE_TAG=$(git rev-parse "$(git merge-base HEAD upstream/main)") \
  mise run e2e:kubernetes
```

To pin a specific released version, use its semver tag without a `v` prefix
(`0.0.115`, not `v0.0.115`):

```shell
OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT=$(oc config current-context) \
  OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBERNETES_FEATURES="e2e,e2e-kubernetes" \
  IMAGE_TAG=0.0.115 \
  mise run e2e:kubernetes
```

A semver tag matches a released commit, which may be behind `main`; if your
branch CLI needs a newer feature, pin the SHA of your branch's base instead.

Confirm a tag exists before relying on it (set `TAG` to the tag you plan to use):

```shell
TAG=0.0.115
skopeo inspect "docker://ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/gateway:${TAG}"
```

`IMAGE_TAG` sets the default tag for the gateway/supervisor image pair; the CLI
under test is always built from your branch. To validate against images from
your exact commit instead, build and push them and point
`OPENSHELL_REGISTRY`/`IMAGE_TAG` at them.

Test wrappers accept independent image overrides:

```shell
GATEWAY_IMAGE=registry.example.com/custom/gateway:test \
SUPERVISOR_IMAGE=registry.example.com/custom/supervisor:test \
SANDBOX_IMAGE=registry.example.com/custom/sandbox:test \
mise run e2e:kubernetes
```

`GATEWAY_IMAGE` applies to the Kubernetes gateway container. `SUPERVISOR_IMAGE`
applies to the trusted supervisor image selected by the Kubernetes, Docker, and
Podman wrappers. `SANDBOX_IMAGE` applies to the trusted workload-side runtime
image that stages the `openshell-sandbox` binary. A repository-only value
inherits `IMAGE_TAG`; a value with an explicit tag or `@sha256:` digest is used
as-is. When these variables are unset, the existing `OPENSHELL_REGISTRY` plus
`IMAGE_TAG` behavior is retained.
The Docker and Podman wrappers continue to give
`OPENSHELL_DOCKER_SUPERVISOR_IMAGE` and `OPENSHELL_SUPERVISOR_IMAGE` precedence
over `SUPERVISOR_IMAGE`.

Digest-pinned Kubernetes overrides require disabling local image builds, because
Docker cannot tag a locally built image with a digest reference:

```shell
OPENSHELL_E2E_KUBE_BUILD_IMAGES=0 \
GATEWAY_IMAGE=registry.example.com/custom/gateway@sha256:<digest> \
SUPERVISOR_IMAGE=registry.example.com/custom/supervisor@sha256:<digest> \
mise run e2e:kubernetes
```
