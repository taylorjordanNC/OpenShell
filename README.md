> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New in OpenShell 0.1.0:** a stable release cadence, an improved security model, an expanded extension surface, and new APIs. [Read the 0.1.0 upgrade guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/latest/upgrade/0-1-0).

OpenShell is the safe, private runtime for autonomous AI agents. It provides sandboxed execution environments that protect your data, credentials, and infrastructure — governed by declarative YAML policies that prevent unauthorized file access, data exfiltration, and uncontrolled network activity.

OpenShell is built agent-first. It ships public agent skills for using and operating OpenShell, plus separate repository-aware workflows for contributors and maintainers.

## Install OpenShell

### Prerequisites

- **A supported host** — Linux, macOS (Apple Silicon), or Windows with WSL 2 (experimental).
- **A local runtime** — Docker, Podman, or host virtualization enabled for MicroVM-backed sandboxes.

### Install

**Local installation:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer installs the latest stable release by default. See [Prerelease and development builds](#prerelease-and-development-builds) to install an upcoming release or the latest commit on `main`.

**Kubernetes installation:**

> **Experimental** — the Kubernetes deployment path is under active development. Expect rough edges and breaking changes.
> **Required:** Your cluster CNI MUST enforce Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` for
> ingress and egress in every sandbox namespace. OpenShell creates the policies,
> but Kubernetes does not verify that the CNI applies them.

Deploy the OpenShell gateway into a Kubernetes cluster from the OCI chart published to GHCR:

```bash
helm install openshell oci://ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/helm-chart
```

See [`deploy/helm/openshell/README.md`](deploy/helm/openshell/README.md) for available versions, dev tag conventions, and configuration.

For deploying OpenShell on OpenShift, see [`deploy/helm/openshell/README.md#install-on-openshift`](deploy/helm/openshell/README.md#install-on-openshift).

### Create a sandbox

```bash
openshell sandbox create --name demo
```

The gateway defaults to `nvcr.io/nvidia/base/ubuntu:24.04`, a minimal Ubuntu
Noble workload. To run an agent, build or select an OCI image that contains the
agent and pass its explicit reference:

```bash
openshell sandbox create --from registry.example.com/agents/my-agent:1.0 -- my-agent
```

Attach the providers and policy required by that workload.

### See network policy in action

Every sandbox starts with **minimal outbound access**. You open additional access with a short YAML policy that the proxy enforces at the HTTP method and path level, without restarting anything.

```bash
# 1. Create a sandbox (starts with minimal outbound access)
openshell sandbox create

# 2. Inside the sandbox — blocked
sandbox$ curl -sS https://api.github.com/zen
curl: (56) Received HTTP code 403 from proxy after CONNECT

# 3. Back on the host — apply a read-only GitHub API policy
sandbox$ exit
openshell policy set demo --policy examples/sandbox-policy-quickstart/policy.yaml --wait

# 4. Reconnect — GET allowed, POST blocked by L7
openshell sandbox connect demo
sandbox$ curl -sS https://api.github.com/zen
Anything added dilutes everything else.

sandbox$ curl -sS -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/issues -d '{"title":"oops"}'
{"error":"policy_denied","detail":"POST /repos/octocat/hello-world/issues not permitted by policy"}
```

See the [full walkthrough](examples/sandbox-policy-quickstart/) or run the automated demo:

```bash
bash examples/sandbox-policy-quickstart/demo.sh
```

## SDKs

OpenShell provides client SDKs for Python, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. SDK packages connect applications to an OpenShell gateway; they do not install the `openshell` CLI. Use the SDK and gateway from the same OpenShell release when possible.

### Python

The [Python SDK](python/openshell/) is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openshell/):

```shell
uv add openshell
```

### TypeScript

The [TypeScript SDK](sdk/typescript/README.md) is published to GitHub Packages as `@nvidia/openshell-sdk`. Configure the `@nvidia` npm scope for `https://npm.pkg.github.com`, authenticate with a token that has `read:packages`, and install it:

```shell
npm install @nvidia/openshell-sdk
```

### Go

Add the [Go SDK](sdk/go/README.md) to a Go module:

```shell
go get github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/sdk/go@latest
```

### Rust

The [Rust SDK](crates/openshell-sdk/README.md) is currently consumed from source. Pin the Git dependency to the same OpenShell release as the gateway:

```shell
cargo add openshell-sdk \
  --git https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell \
  --tag <release-tag>
```

## How It Works

OpenShell isolates each sandbox in its own container with policy-enforced egress routing. A lightweight gateway coordinates sandbox lifecycle, and every outbound connection is intercepted by the policy engine, which does one of three things:

- **Allows** — the destination and binary match a policy block.
- **Binds credentials to endpoints** — injects provider credentials only after policy admits a request to a profile-authorized endpoint.
- **Denies** — blocks the request and logs it.

| Component          | Role                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gateway**        | Control-plane API that coordinates sandbox lifecycle and acts as the auth boundary.          |
| **Sandbox**        | Isolated runtime with container supervision and policy-enforced egress routing.              |
| **Policy Engine**  | Enforces filesystem, network, and process constraints from application layer down to kernel. |
| **Provider Access** | Profile-defined endpoints, binary policy, and endpoint-bound credential injection for model APIs and other services. |

OpenShell runs a gateway control plane that manages sandbox lifecycle through a configured compute driver. Supported compute platforms include Docker, Podman, MicroVM, and Kubernetes.

## Protection Layers

OpenShell applies defense in depth across four policy domains:

| Layer      | What it protects                                    | When it applies             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Filesystem | Prevents reads/writes outside allowed paths.        | Locked at sandbox creation. |
| Network    | Blocks unauthorized outbound connections.           | Hot-reloadable at runtime.  |
| Process    | Blocks privilege escalation and dangerous syscalls. | Locked at sandbox creation. |
| Providers  | Grants endpoint-bound credentials and network access. | Hot-reloadable at runtime. |

Policies are declarative YAML files. Static sections (filesystem, process) are locked at creation; network policy and provider attachments can be updated on a running sandbox.

## Providers

Agents need credentials — API keys, tokens, service accounts. OpenShell manages these as **providers**: named credential bundles that are injected into sandboxes at creation. Credentials never leak into the sandbox filesystem; they are injected as environment variables at runtime.

A provider is created from a **provider profile**, which declares the credentials, endpoints, and client binaries the provider needs. Profiles are import-only: a gateway serves exactly the profiles you imported with `openshell provider profile import`, and ships none of its own. The [`providers/`](providers/) directory holds reviewable examples to copy and adapt. Once a profile is imported, the CLI can auto-discover credentials for its provider from your shell environment, or you can create providers explicitly with `openshell provider create`.

Inference access uses the same provider workflow. Attach an inference-capable provider to a sandbox, call the provider's native endpoint, and select the model in the client. Provider profiles contribute the endpoint policy and bind credential placeholders to the authorized destination.

## GPU Support (Experimental)

> **Experimental** — GPU passthrough works on supported hosts but is under active development. Expect rough edges and breaking changes.

OpenShell can pass host GPUs into sandboxes for local inference, fine-tuning, or any GPU workload. Add `--gpu` when creating a sandbox:

```bash
openshell sandbox create --gpu --from registry.example.com/your-org/gpu-agent:latest -- claude
```

Docker-backed GPU sandboxes auto-select CDI when available and otherwise fall back to Docker's NVIDIA GPU request path (`--gpus all`).

**Requirements:** NVIDIA drivers and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) must be installed on the host. The sandbox image itself must include the appropriate GPU drivers and libraries for your workload — the default Ubuntu image does not. See the [BYOC example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/tree/main/examples/bring-your-own-container) for building a custom sandbox image with GPU support.

## Running Agents

OpenShell can run Linux agents packaged in OCI images. The default Ubuntu
workload does not bundle agent CLIs. Build or select an image containing your
agent, then authorize its binary paths, service endpoints, and credentials. See
[Run Your First Agent](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/latest/about/run-an-agent)
for the image, provider, and policy workflow.

## Key Commands

| Command                                                    | Description                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `openshell sandbox create -- <agent>`                      | Create a sandbox and launch an agent.           |
| `openshell sandbox connect [name]`                         | SSH into a running sandbox.                     |
| `openshell sandbox list`                                   | List all sandboxes.                             |
| `openshell provider create --type [type] --from-existing`  | Create a credential provider from env vars.     |
| `openshell sandbox provider attach <sandbox> <provider>`   | Attach a provider to a running sandbox.         |
| `openshell policy set <name> --policy file.yaml`           | Apply or update a policy on a running sandbox.  |
| `openshell policy get <name>`                              | Show the active policy.                         |
| `openshell logs [name] --tail`                             | Stream sandbox logs.                            |
| `openshell term`                                           | Launch the real-time terminal UI for debugging. |

See the [full documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/latest) for command guides, tutorials, and reference material.

## Terminal UI

OpenShell includes a real-time terminal dashboard for monitoring gateways, sandboxes, and providers — inspired by [k9s](https://k9scli.io/).

```bash
openshell term
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="fern/assets/images/openshell-terminal.png" alt="OpenShell Terminal UI">
</p>

The TUI gives you a live, keyboard-driven view of your gateway and sandboxes. Navigate with `Tab` to switch panels, `j`/`k` to move through lists, `Enter` to select, and `:` for command mode. Gateway health and sandbox status auto-refresh every two seconds.

## Workload Images and BYOC

Use `--from` with an explicit OCI image reference:

```bash
docker build -t my-sandbox:latest ./my-sandbox-dir
openshell sandbox create --from my-sandbox:latest

podman build -t localhost/my-sandbox:latest ./my-sandbox-dir
openshell sandbox create --from localhost/my-sandbox:latest

openshell sandbox create --from registry.example.com/agents/my-agent:1.0
```

Build with the container engine used by your local gateway. For a remote
gateway, push the image to a registry that the gateway can pull from. See the
[BYOC example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/tree/main/examples/bring-your-own-container).

## Use OpenShell with Your Agent

OpenShell provides four portable skills for users and operators: CLI workflows (`openshell-cli`), gateway troubleshooting (`debug-openshell-cluster`), inference troubleshooting (`debug-inference`), and policy generation (`generate-sandbox-policy`). Install them with the Agent Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add NVIDIA/OpenShell
```

These public, installable skills live in [`skills/`](skills/) and use the installed CLI help and [published documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/latest/index.html) as their sources of truth. They do not require an OpenShell source checkout.

## Built With Agents

OpenShell is developed using the same agent-driven workflows it enables. Contributor and maintainer skills live separately in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/); they automate work on the OpenShell repository and are not included when users install the public skills:

- **Spike and build:** Investigate a problem with `create-spike`; a human accepts it with `state:accepted` or [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/NVIDIA/projects/233) placement, or declines it. Accepted work can remain human-owned or enter the optional, human-gated `agent:*` planning and implementation workflow.
- **Triage and route:** Community issues are assessed with `triage-issue`. Agents establish technical validity and impact; humans decide whether the project should act and where the work sits on the roadmap.
- **Security review:** `review-security-issue` produces a severity assessment and remediation plan. `fix-security-issue` implements it.
- **Repository maintenance:** `sync-agent-infra`, `update-docs-from-commits`, and other internal workflows keep code, documentation, and agent infrastructure consistent.

Agent implementation is human-directed: a user may request a phase directly, or maintainers may use the optional `agent:*` workflow to queue and approve planning and implementation. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full workflow chain documentation.

## Prerelease and development builds

Use a prerelease candidate to evaluate an upcoming release, or use the rolling development build to test the latest commit on `main`. These builds may change before the next stable release. The matching documentation is published in the [development channel](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/dev/index.html).

Prerelease packages are retained as GitHub Actions artifacts for 90 days and require an authenticated [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) session. The `pre` alias installs the latest prerelease:

```shell
gh auth login
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/main/install.sh | \
  OPENSHELL_VERSION=pre sh
```

The installer downloads only the artifact for the current platform and rejects expired candidates during discovery. Installed packages retain the candidate's exact version, such as `0.1.0-pre.3`. Prerelease tags do not create entries on the GitHub Releases page.

The rolling [`dev` release](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/releases/tag/dev) does not require GitHub authentication:

```shell
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/main/install.sh | \
  OPENSHELL_VERSION=dev sh
```

For Kubernetes, select the corresponding Helm chart version. Helm chart versions omit the leading `v` from release tags:

```shell
# Pin an exact candidate
helm upgrade --install openshell \
  oci://ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/helm-chart \
  --version 0.1.0-pre.3

# Rolling development build
helm upgrade --install openshell \
  oci://ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/helm-chart \
  --version 0.0.0-dev
```

Prerelease charts use exact `<version>-pre.N` versions. Development charts are also published as immutable `0.0.0-dev.<commit-sha>` versions when you need to pin a specific commit. See the [Helm chart documentation](deploy/helm/openshell/README.md#available-versions) for version and configuration details.

## Contributing

OpenShell is built agent-first. Issues should include a user story, problem statement, impact, and acceptance criteria. The impact should explain the consequences of the current behavior and why existing workarounds are insufficient. Feature requests also require a workflow-level proposed design and alternatives; bug reports add reproduction steps, environment details, and relevant logs. Once work is authorized through the project workflow or a direct request, contributors should use the skills in `.agents/skills/` to investigate the current code and behavior, implement the change, and verify it. If an issue contains earlier diagnostics, verify them rather than relying on them. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full agent skills table, contribution workflow, and development setup.

## Telemetry

OpenShell collects anonymous telemetry to help improve the project for developers. This data is not used to track individual user behavior. It helps us understand aggregate usage of sandbox, provider, and policy workflows so we can prioritize product improvements and share usage trends with the community.

Disable telemetry at runtime by setting `OPENSHELL_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` on the gateway deployment. For Helm installs, set `server.telemetryEnabled=false`. OpenShell propagates this deployment setting into sandbox supervisor environments so sandbox-side telemetry collection is disabled as well.

You can also compile telemetry out entirely. Telemetry support is a default-on `telemetry` Cargo feature, and each crate that carries it also defines a `defaults-without-telemetry` alias covering every other default feature. Build telemetry-free artifacts with `--no-default-features --features defaults-without-telemetry`:

```shell
cargo build --release -p openshell-gateway --no-default-features --features defaults-without-telemetry
cargo build --release -p openshell-sandbox --no-default-features --features defaults-without-telemetry
cargo build --release -p openshell-driver-vm --no-default-features --features defaults-without-telemetry
```

The resulting binaries contain no telemetry endpoint, no telemetry HTTP client, and no emission code. With telemetry compiled out, the gateway emits nothing and reports telemetry disabled to the sandboxes it launches. Cargo has no way to subtract a single default feature, so `defaults-without-telemetry` must be paired with `--no-default-features`; passing it on its own leaves the defaults in place and fails the build rather than producing a binary that still emits.

The gateway also exposes separate Cargo features for its built-in compute drivers: `compute-driver-kubernetes`, `compute-driver-docker`, `compute-driver-podman`, `compute-driver-vm`, and `compute-driver-mxc`. Disable the default feature set, then enable only the drivers and telemetry mode required by the target binary. For example:

```shell
# Docker only, with telemetry support.
cargo build --release -p openshell-gateway --no-default-features --features telemetry,compute-driver-docker

# Docker and VM only, with telemetry compiled out.
cargo build --release -p openshell-gateway --no-default-features --features compute-driver-docker,compute-driver-vm

# Windows MXC only, with telemetry support and bundled Z3.
cargo build --release -p openshell-gateway --no-default-features --features telemetry,compute-driver-mxc,bundled-z3
```

Regular builds retain their platform driver set through the default `in-tree-compute-drivers` compatibility feature. On Windows, `compute-driver-mxc` selects MXC; the other four features install unsupported-driver stubs. On other platforms, MXC is excluded.

Telemetry events are limited to anonymous operational categories and counts, such as sandbox lifecycle outcomes, provider profile buckets, policy decision counts, and aggregate network activity denial categories. OpenShell telemetry does not collect sandbox names or IDs, hostnames, file paths, binary paths, prompts, credentials, provider names, model names, or user content.

Opting out applies only to telemetry emitted by OpenShell. Third-party services, model providers, inference endpoints, agents, or tools that you configure and use with OpenShell may have their own terms and privacy practices.

We publish aggregate usage trends from this telemetry every two weeks. See the [community telemetry reports](telemetry/README.md) for the latest summary.
