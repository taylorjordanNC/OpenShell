# Policy Advisor end-to-end test

Deterministic, no-LLM exercise of the agent-driven policy loop:

1. Start a sandbox with a read-only GitHub L7 policy.
2. From inside the sandbox, attempt a GitHub contents PUT and assert OpenShell
   returns a structured `policy_denied` 403.
3. Submit a narrow `addRule` proposal through `http://policy.local/v1/proposals`.
4. Approve the draft from the host and retry until the write succeeds.

This proves the proxy, the structured deny body, the `policy.local` HTTP API,
the gateway proposal path, and the hot-reload of approved rules — without
involving an LLM. The user-facing demo (`examples/agent-driven-policy-management/`)
runs the same loop with Codex driving from inside the sandbox.

## Run it

Run against an ephemeral Docker gateway:

```bash
DEMO_GITHUB_OWNER=<your-handle> \
DEMO_GITHUB_REPO=openshell-policy-demo \
e2e/with-docker-gateway.sh bash -lc '
  target/debug/openshell settings set --global \
    --key agent_policy_proposals_enabled \
    --value true \
    --yes
  OPENSHELL_BIN="$PWD/target/debug/openshell" bash e2e/policy-advisor/test.sh
'
```

To keep the sandbox for debugging, start a local gateway first with
`mise run gateway:docker`, then run:

```bash
target/debug/openshell settings set --global \
  --key agent_policy_proposals_enabled \
  --value true \
  --yes

OPENSHELL_GATEWAY=docker-dev \
OPENSHELL_BIN="$PWD/target/debug/openshell" \
DEMO_KEEP_SANDBOX=1 \
DEMO_GITHUB_OWNER=<your-handle> \
DEMO_GITHUB_REPO=openshell-policy-demo \
bash e2e/policy-advisor/test.sh
```

Requires Docker, `agent_policy_proposals_enabled=true`, and a GitHub token with
contents write on the repository. The test auto-resolves the token from
`DEMO_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `gh auth token`.

## Conformance coverage

The `policy-advisor` conformance group checks mechanistic draft generation and
uses `policy.local` to inspect policy, submit a narrow permission request, and
read the resulting proposal. Run the group against a configured gateway with
`--openshell-bin` pointing to the CLI under test:

```bash
openshell-conformance run --group policy-advisor --openshell-bin target/debug/openshell
```

Run `openshell-conformance list` to see each scenario and its group. You can
also run either scenario by name.

The GitHub write test above and the regressions below still exercise distinct
proposal review, approval, and hot-reload behavior.

The #2821 regression additionally verifies that a denial on an existing
inspected endpoint becomes a binary expansion, auto-approves, hot-reloads, and
does not downgrade the endpoint to L4:

```bash
mise run e2e:mechanistic-existing-endpoint
```
